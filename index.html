					<p>Hello. You must have already read my name in the site's table of contents.
					   But still, from the rules of etiquette, I will introduce myself.
					   Ivan Ivanovich Ivanenko my name is already fifty-two years.
					   I have over 25 years of experience in medicine.</p>
					   
					<p>He began his career in medicine with military surgery. Then I was a little over twenty.
					   It was then that I got a base that goes with me throughout my life.
					   Of course, it's silly to say that I worked only with this base. 
					   Let's just say she gave me a firm hand both 
					   in making decisions and in the focus of my actions.</p>
					
					<p>I was attracted by a deeper understanding of things in the world.
					   So it happened with my profession.Therefore, I embarked on the path 
					   of a complete study of our body, its actions and principles. This is 
					   not to say that before that I did not know something, in any case. I 
					   will lead to the fact that from an ordinary doctor I became a specialist 
					   not only in the field of surgery, but also studied the principles of our digestive
					   system and the work of the entire metabolism.</p>
					   
					<p>My blog is aimed at helping people who are overweight or, conversely, suffering from anorexia.
						Also consultations about the operation. I also give lectures at the capital's universities.</p>
